# CS231n Road Segmentation Project
The interconnected society we live in is highly dependent on roads for transportation. However, obtaining a good ground truth mapping of road locations may require significant location data, or mapping roads manually, which is an enormous task. This is especially problematic in rural areas and less developed areas. 

In this project, we investigated automatic road network generation using satellite imagery. Our aim was to develop a deep neural network that is robust enough to generate segmentations of roads from both urban and rural satellite images.
